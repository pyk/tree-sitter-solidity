==================
Simple receive function
==================

contract C {
  receive() external payable {}
}

    name: (identifier)
    receive: (receive_function_definition
      visibility: (visibility)

==================
Receive function with a body
==================

contract C {
  event Received(address, uint);
  receive() external payable {
    emit Received(msg.sender, msg.value);
  }
}
