==================
Receive function with a modifier
==================

==================
Virtual receive function
==================

contract Base {
    receive() external payable virtual {}
}

      body: (block))))

==================
Overriding receive function
==================

contract Base {
    receive() external payable virtual;
}
contract Derived is Base {
    receive() external payable override {}
}

(source_file
  definition: (contract
    name: (symbol
      name: (identifier))

    definition: (receive
      visibility: (external)
      mutability: (payable)
      override: (overrides)
      body: (block))))

==================
Unimplemented receive function (in abstract contract)
==================

abstract contract C {
    receive() external payable virtual;
}
