==================
Precedence of comparison vs equality
==================
// Should parse as `(a > b) == c`
contract C {
  function f() {
    bool r = 1 > 2 == true;
  }
}

==================
Interaction with bitwise operators
==================
// Comparison has higher precedence than bitwise OR
contract C {
  function f() {
    bool r = 1 > 0 | 2 > 1;
  }
}
